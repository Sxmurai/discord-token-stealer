# discord-token-stealer
Shitty, yet simple discord injector to add a little spice to their discord client

**Disclaimer**: This is for **educational** purposes only, and is not meant to actually RAT people.

It's easily detectable if they were to look in this directory, but 9 times outta 10 they're not gonna, so...

Pro-tip: obfuscate the js file so they dont know what's going on in there :trollface:

Could I have made this better and inject somewhere else? Yes, but I don't give a shit cause I made this only cause I was bored.
